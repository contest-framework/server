# Running the Tertestrial server

Start Tertestrial by running `tertestrial` in a terminal.

If you run tertestrial in the background via `tertestrial &`, you can see all
Tertestrial output and your terminal remains interactive: you can keep running
other commands there as well. Just start typing in the terminal to see your
command prompt. To exit the Tertestrial server in this situation, run `fg` to
bring tertestrial back into the foreground, then press **ctrl-c**.
