# Running the Contest server

Start Contest by running `contest` in a terminal. Configure your IDE and start
sending Contest commands.

If you run contest in the background via `contest &`, you can see all Contest
output and your terminal remains interactive: you can keep running other
commands there as well. Just start typing in the terminal to see your command
prompt. To exit the Contest server in this situation, run `fg` to bring contest
back into the foreground, then press **ctrl-c**.
